REQUIRES PYTHON 2.7!
module load python/GEOSpyD/Ana2019.10_py2.7
practically speaking it is only *TOGETHER.py that needs to be run

Updated passive degassing set from second page of OMI*.xls and stored
locally in so2_passive_degassing_2005-2019_20210715.txt
This inventory is valid 2005 - 2019, so modify python code to cope
with that. And have updated explosive emissions in provided text
file MSVOLSO2L4_20210621.txt

copied this from Valentina:
/archive/u/vaquila/volcanic_databases/volcanic_datasets_carn_20180523.tar

also find here toms_omi_inventory.20180523.txt, which is explosive database
she requests directly from Simon Carn

also find here Sci._Rep._2017_Carn.xls, which is the degassing dataset she got
directly from Simon Carn

I exported the first sheet of the XLS file as a tab delimited text file that
might even work with the python scripts




NOTES:
These python codes require modules not standard. Must load, e.g., by
setting up GEOS/GAAS environment. Must also create sub-directories
savepathExplosive
savepathDegassing
and then run:
python convert_carn2geos5_degassing_explosive.py

and then the one you really want is
mkdir volcanic_CARN_1978-2020_v202005
python convert_carn2geos5_degassing_explosive_TOGETHER.py
